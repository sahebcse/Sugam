#Here I have compiled the statistics or ground reality of medical services condtion in hilly and tribal regions from various news articles..official reports filed by the goverment... WHO...World bank .

In the end I have tried to mention some points where telemedicine can come in hand to solve the issue.


 Ailing healthcare services in Uttarakhand's hilly areas forces migration to urban centres; lack of doctors cripples hospitals
Some hospitals in Uttarakhand face not only a shortage of doctors but also of paramedical staff, highlighting the seriousness of the healthcare facilities the state lacks.

—------------------------------------------------------------
A study found that 8% of residents of Uttarakhand's hilly areas have migrated to urban locations due to lack of medical facilities
The idea of a 'ghost village' is now a reality in Uttarakhand, where remote villages in the hills lack basic amenities like roadways, health centres and schools. 

—------------------------------------------------------------
According to a report by the Rural Development and Migration Commission, 8 percent of residents have migrated out of Uttarakhand's hilly areas to urban locations due to lack of medical facilities. The fact that doctors born and brought up in the hills are not ready to serve in its remote areas has become a matter of grave concern.

—------------------------------------------------------------
For villagers in the hills who are having symptoms, it is a herculean task to get medical help or even reach a health facility. For instance, in district, the nearest primary healthcare centre (PHC) from the remote Bantoli village is 22 km away and there are no private labs in the area to cater to the needs of people who are experiencing Covid-like symptoms. Most villagers also don’t want to go to the PHCs which have only basic facilities. “Currently, there are 30 women, 10 men and at least a dozen children suffering from fever, cold and cough in our area. We don’t want to go to the PHCs which have inadequate facilities and mainly act as ‘referral centres’ from where patients are simply sent to - another 40 km away, ” said Vijendra Singh Rawat, a local from Bantoli village

Similarly, in , villagers are finding it difficult to even get a public vehicle to ferry them to hospitals. “People are reluctant when they are told that someone has medical issues and afraid to take someone who might be Covid-positive in their vehicles. Hospitals are far away and those nearby lack adequate facilities. I know a lot of villagers are down with fever and cold, but unable to get any medical help, ” said Mohit Dimri, an activist in Rudraprayag district.

—------------------------------------------------------------
 chief medical officer Dr said, “We are constantly monitoring the villages. We have deployed a doctor and nurse for each village who are conducting antigen tests regularly.”



—------------------------------------------------------------
Healthcare in India’s villages is a three-tiered structure under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)--sub-centres, primary health centres and community health centres.
 
—------------------------------------------------------------
Sub-centres are at the forefront, covering 5,000 people in the plains and 3,000 in hill or tribal areas. PHCs are equally important for the Ayushman Bharat Yojana to succeed because they are the first link to a consultation with a medical doctor and act as referral points for specialist consultations at community health centres.
—------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution of health professionals skewed in favour of cities
Seventy percent of India’s population lives in villages and 30% in urban areas. But the distribution of health workers leaves rural India with little access to healthcare--60% of the country’s 2-million strong health workforce caters to urban India, only the remaining 40% services villages, as per data from a 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report.
 
—------------------------------------------------------------

There is another issue the proposed centres will have to deal with: Health-workers practising in both urban and rural areas of India are not adequately qualified, as per the WHO study. Among urban and rural allopathic doctors, only 58% and 19% doctors, respectively, were medically qualified. As for nurses and midwives practising in rural areas, only 33% have studied beyond secondary school and 11% have medical qualification, the report estimated.
—------------------------------------------------------------

A perception survey of patients who visited healthcare facilities more than once showed that 43% patients, on average, across four states were not satisfied with the medical treatment provided by the health facilities. Of the patients surveyed, 34% complained of staff absenteeism, 32% of shortage of medicines 13% of long waits; 3% said centres were shut, 2% claimed that there were no facilities at all and the remaining 5% alleged different acts of corruption, according to the 2011 report by the High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage.

—------------------------------------------------------------
Low access to public healthcare means reliance on private practitioners
A potential area of concern for the new wellness centres could be the reliance of rural patients on non-degree allopathic practitioners (NDAPs)--practitioners without an MBBS--according to a study carried out in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Studies in rural Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have shown reliance on private practitioners for multiple reasons. The biggest of these is the lack of easy access to public health facilities: 73% sub-centres were more than 3 km from patients, 28% sub-centres and 20% PHCs were not accessible by public transport, concluded an IndiaSpend analysis of a Comptroller and Auditor General report.
 —------------------------------------------------------------



Why qualified medical professionals avoid rural India
Retention of doctors in rural areas is a major challenge which Ayushman Bharat is yet to confront: A 2011 study funded by the World Bank and the UK department of international development found that 39% medical providers in PHCs in 19 major states were counted “absent”.
Poor living and working conditions, irregular drug supply, weak infrastructure, professional isolation and the burden of administrative work--these are some of the challenges faced by doctors on rural postings, stated a 2017 study by the Public Health Foundation of India.

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Our state turned 18 just a few months ago (in November), and yet, we do not have enough doctors at health centres here, especially in the remote hilly areas. Sure, government hospital buildings look swanky and modern, but what is the point of that if the number of people being treated and cured is abysmally low? That's why more and more families are migrating to urban areas," Maikhuri rued.

—------------------------------------------------------------
This sorry situation extends to all government hospitals in the Garhwal division. Right from Rudraprayag to Srinagar, every hospital has been transformed into a mere referral centre instead of one that actually provides treatment. Even Srinagar's government medical college faces this problem due to insufficient specialists. In such a scenario, the poor are living in 'Ram bharose', while those who have money are shifting to Dehradun and other better-connected areas."


—------------------------------------------------------------
The activist added: "Just a few days ago, a woman in Karnaprayag died because she didn't receive the right treatment. And she wasn't the first either. There have been several cases of pregnant women delivering their babies on roads and in other unsterile conditions."

—------------------------------------------------------------
The whole point of a separate state was to give locals from the hills more facilities and a better life, but not much has changed. Our district headquarters is 15 to 20 kilometres away from the village. We had to go all the way there for treatment during my childhood and even now. The only difference is that earlier, we went in palanquins and now, there is a road. Small mercies!

Uttarakhand healthcare crisis: Citizens face shortage of doctors, crumbling infrastructure as BJP's PPP model fails to deliver
The problem of an acute shortage of doctors in Uttarakhand is a very real one, largely because of an unwillingness to serve in rural areas.

—------------------------------------------------------------
A pregnant lady delivers her baby in the toilet. Doctors perform surgeries under light from torches and candles. There are no oxygen points for two dozen patients suffering from chlorine inhalation. This is the condition at Doon Hospital, Uttarakhand’s biggest government healthcare centre in the state capital of Dehradun. One can imagine, then, the state of healthcare centres in the remote hilly areas.

—------------------------------------------------------------
But the reality on the ground is a crumbling rural health infrastructure, one of the primary causes of Uttarakhand’s migration crisis with about eight percent of the hill population having moved to towns in the plains. 

—------------------------------------------------------------
The problem of an acute shortage of doctors is a very real one, largely because of an unwillingness to serve in rural areas. Ravindra Thapliyal, director general of Health and Medical Services, said of the 2,727 sanctioned posts, only 1,589 doctors are permanent appointees in various government hospitals. “Another 456 doctors have been appointed on contract with 681 posts lying vacant,” said Thapliyal. Most posts of super-specialist doctors are vacant in almost every hospital in the hills for a long time.

—------------------------------------------------------------
Reena, a Tehri resident, was given this kind of runaround last month when complications arose in her pregnancy. “My husband took me to the district hospital in Tehri,” said Reena. “After seeing my condition I was referred to a bigger hospital in Dehradun. Eventually, I was admitted to a missionary hospital at Chamba where I received treatment. This is the situation in the Tehri district hospital, where neither a proper doctor nor an ultrasound machine was available.” Reena eventually miscarried.

—------------------------------------------------------------

 The 108 emergency number ambulance services, a critical service needed in the hill areas, is also not available due to lack of funds.”
—------------------------------------------------------------
Baluni is one of the 734 revenue villages of Uttarakhand that has no residents at all anymore
Villagers move to urban areas for better healthcare and other facilities
The lack of proper transport infrastructure also makes habitation difficult in such remote villages
After my wife died soon after our son's birth, I raised my five daughters and one son in the same village where scarcity of drinking water still exists. After my daughters got married and my son joined the Indian Army, I lived in Baluni all alone for five years. I am 69 now and have health issues that are increasing day by day," Shyam Prasad said.

—------------------------------------------------------------
My son suggested that I shift to an urban area as there is no medical facility at my native place. Right now, I live in a rented house in Kotdwar. I deeply miss my village, but I have no choice but to stay here. Once the climate becomes conducive, I would like to visit my village. But it is the bitter truth that I can't live in the only house I built for myself and my family," he added.

—------------------------------------------------------------
India’s poor tribal people have far worse health indicators than the general population. Most tribal people live in remote rural hamlets in hilly, forested or desert areas where illiteracy, trying physical environments, malnutrition, inadequate access to potable water, and lack of personal hygiene and sanitation make them more vulnerable to disease.

This is compounded by the lack of awareness among these populations about the measures needed to protect their health, their distance from medical facilities, the lack of all-weather roads and affordable transportation, insensitive and discriminatory behavior by staff at medical facilities, financial constraints and so on. Government programs to raise their health awareness and improve their accessibility to primary health care have not had the desired impact. Not surprisingly, tribal people suffer illnesses of greater severity and duration, with women and children being the most vulnerable. The starkest marker of tribal deprivation is child mortality, with under-five mortality rates among rural tribal children remaining startlingly high, at about 100 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005 compared with 82 among all children.

—------------------------------------------------------------
 Malaria, pneumonia, respiratory disorders, snake and scorpion bites, diarrhea and fever are commonly reported ailments. Tribal people have lower levels of antenatal care, fewer institutional deliveries, lower levels of immunization, and higher prevalence of reproductive tract and sexually transmitted infections.

—------------------------------------------------------------
Lack of awareness of health issues
Without awareness of health issues, most tribal populations tend to fall ill more frequently and wait too long before seeking medical help, or are referred too late by untrained village practitioners. In the past, most health awareness campaigns, which need significant investments over long periods of time for noticeable impact, were planned by the medical community instead of by communications experts. The form and content of health messages was not pre-tested to ensure proper comprehension and absorption by target groups. Moreover, the campaigns’ meager effect was easily nullified by the tribal population’s poor experience with health workers.


—------------------------------------------------------------
Lack of health facilities in remote rural areas
Past efforts to bring health care to the poor through outreach camps and mobile health units have not had the desired impact. Coverage of remote tribal areas was found to be poor, a large number of positions lay vacant, the availability of drugs was inadequate, and vehicles frequently broke down because of poor maintenance. Even where brick-and mortar health facilities were set up, they were often insufficiently equipped with drugs and medical supplies and faced a shortage of trained doctors, nurses and paramedical staff.

—------------------------------------------------------------
Lack of emergency transportation
Typically, pregnant women or sick persons from remote tribal hamlets are unable to make it to health facilities in time for institutional deliveries or emergency medical care for want of easily available and affordable transportation.

—------------------------------------------------------------
Financial constraints
As most rural tribal populations live below the poverty line, the lack of funds influences how much and what type of health care they receive, and determines whether households are able to maintain their living standards when one of their members falls ill. Poor tribal people often have to borrow money, mortgage land or animals, or pawn jewelry to meet medical expenses, or else let the sick person die. They also cannot sustain the opportunity cost of a doctor’s visit, much less of a protracted hospital stay, often dropping out half-way through a course of treatment as it means leaving their crops, animals, and family unattended.

—------------------------------------------------------------
provide emergency transportation to take pregnant tribal women to health facilities for obstetric care. While not all hamlets have access to tarred roads, the emergency ambulance services reach the nearest motorable point to pick up patients in all three states.
—------------------------------------------------------------
. Employing Health Workers from Tribal Communities
As tribal populations find it difficult to navigate through the complexities of medical facilities, all three health projects have made provisions to help them. In partnership with local NGOs, counselors who are often from tribal communities themselves have been placed at district hospitals to guide patients, explain doctors’ prescriptions, help patients take advantage of welfare schemes, and counsel them on preventive and promotive health behaviors.
Patient counselors:  Initially patient counselors were placed at all facilities which had 100 beds or more, in partnership with local NGOs. As these counselors proved quite popular, qualified counselors were directly recruited and placed at all facilities with 50 beds or more.
—------------------------------------------------------------

Tribal counselors: NGOs were contracted to train and place counselors from tribal populations in government hospitals and PHCs in 12 tribal districts. These counselors also pay weekly visits to tribal hamlets to raise awareness about health issues and promote healthy behaviors. Attendance by tribal groups has increased at health facilities. The project is now expanding this service to other tribal districts.

Telemedicine Consultation Centre (TCC)
Telemedicine Consulting Centre is the site where the patient is present. In a Telemedicine Consulting Centre, equipment for scanning / converting, transformation and communicating the patient's medical information can be available.

—------------------------------------------------------------
Telemedicine Specialty Centre (TSC)
Telemedicine Specialty Centre is a site, where the specialist is present. He can interact with the patient present in the remote site and view his reports and monitor his progress.(9)
Telemedicine System
The Telemedicine system consists of an interface between hardware, software and a communication channel to eventually bridge two geographical locations to exchange information and enable teleconsultancy between two locations.
The hardware consists of a computer, printer, scanner, videoconferencing equipment etc. The software enables the acquisition of patient information (images, reports, films etc.). The communication channel enables the connectivity whereby two locations can connect to each other.(10)

—------------------------------------------------------------
A modern telemedicine system
Easy access to remote areas
Using telemedicine in peripheral health set-ups can significantly reduce the time and costs of patient transportation
Monitoring home care and ambulatory monitoring
Improves communications between health providers separated by distance
Critical care monitoring where it is not possible to transfer the patient
Continuing medical education and clinical research
A tool for public awareness
A tool for disaster management
Second opinion and complex interpretations
The greatest hope for use of telemedicine technology is that it can bring the expertise to medical practices once telecommunication has been established.
Telementored procedures-surgery using hand robots
Disease surveillance and program tracking
It provides an opportunity for standardization and equity in provision of healthcare, both within individual countries and across regions and continents.
The Centre for International Rehabilitation recognizes that telecommunication and telemedicine are important technologies to improve and provide rehabilitation services in remote areas. Telemedicine cannot be substitutes for physicians in rural areas especially in developing countries where resources are scarce and public health problems are in plenty. So it is unrealistic to think at this stage of substituting unwilling doctors with this technology. However, it can supplement the current health scenario in a huge way in most countries.

According to the United Nations' child mortality estimates, in 2018, there were 7, 21,000 infant deaths reported all over India. Structural concerns such as lack of transportation facilities, delays in taking patients to hospitals, and inability to provide them with immediate treatments and lack of basic facilities at primary health care centers have increased infant death cases. Besides medical aspects, infant deaths result from more profound social issues such as sanitation, starvation, and immunization.
